The directory Fractal Tree consists of a fractal tree as seen on Wikipedia as an example given for L-Systems. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system

Mathematics is the language of nature. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns emerge. Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature. Evidence: The cycling of disease epidemics; the wax and wane of caribou populations; sun spot cycles; the rise and fall of the Nile. So, what about fractals? The universe of numbers that represents the self-similarity. Millions of iterations at work, billions of repetitions. A vast network, screaming with life. An organism. A natural organism. Our hypothesis: Within fractals, there is a pattern as well. Right in front of us. Hiding behind the numbers. Always has been.

This repository is for playing around with such fractal generation.
